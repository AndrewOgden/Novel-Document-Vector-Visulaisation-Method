# Novel-Document-Vector-Visulaisation-Method
This repository contains the final implementation of a Novel Visualisation technique, based on Cosine similarity and Euclidean distance. This is work towards a masters dissertation at Lancaster University.

The RunVisualisation.py prgram can be run as is and will generate the visualisation for a defualt topic distribution. This changed by editing the list of selected topics. The code is well documented and several changes to the visualiation can be added by simply uncommenting sections of code.
